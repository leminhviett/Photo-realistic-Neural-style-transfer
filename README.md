A Web App - Photo-realistic Neural Style Transfer. This repo contains my research work about the topic of photo-realistic style transfer using deep learning.

The web app is built based on these 2 original repositories:
  * WCT2: https://github.com/ClovaAI/WCT2
  * Semantic Segmentation: https://github.com/CSAILVision/semantic-segmentation-pytorch
